#summary Benchmark datasets readily usable for (deep)Torch.

= MNIST =

As described [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ here], this is the standard digit classification benchmark. The archive containing the training, validation and test file can be downloaded from [http://www-etud.iro.umontreal.ca/~erhandum/mnist.tar.gz here]. The archive contains 3 files, each of them having 785 columns (28x28 grayscale pixel values followed by the label, 0 to 9):

  # `mnist_train.txt`: 50,000 examples
  # `mnist_valid.txt`: 10,000 examples
  # `mnist_test.txt`: 10,000 examples

`mnist_test.txt` contains the same examples as the official test file.
